description: 'Athens, Mykonos and Santorini September is known to be a little windier than the peak of the season in August in Mykonos but for us the weather was almost perfect. We only had to deal with the odd shortly lived shower. Our first stop was Athens, a surprisingly fun and lively city considering its immense history.'
